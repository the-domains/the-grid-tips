# Some Grid Tips I've Learned

Here are some Grid tips (or maybe just general stuff) I've learned since I've started playing with my Beta site.   I'll keep updating this post as I learn anything else new!   Hope this helps anyone out there trying to get their Beta sites up and running!

Q:  So how do I do a numbered list?   

A:  You don't just yet as it is not supported.   There is an item on the Trello board for that.   Oh you didn't there was a Trello board?  [Follow this link and check it out!][0]

Q:  So how do I change the font size of my text?

A:  You don't just yet.  Again follow the link above to the Trello board and vote on having some control over your font size!

Q:  I just posted a mostly text page and I have lots of extra white space appearing between paragraphs and well it just looks like crap!

A:  Try taking the layout setting of the site down to 'minimal' if you are doing a lot of text.   This worked for me regarding getting rid of all the nasty extra white space that made my blog posting look bad.
